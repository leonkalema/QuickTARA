# QuickTARA Step-by-Step Process Flow

This document outlines the sequential flow of a complete TARA (Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment) process with inputs and outputs for each step, fully compliant with ISO/SAE 21434 and UNECE R155 requirements.

## 1. Item Definition (Scope Definition)
**Input needed:** System description, stakeholder requirements, vehicle architecture  
**Output:** Clear item description with boundaries, components, and interfaces  
**Next step:** Asset Identification

## 2. Asset Identification
**Input needed:** Item definition, system documentation  
**Output:** Asset inventory with security properties (C-I-A, authenticity, authorization, non-repudiation)  
**Next step:** Damage Scenario Identification

## 3. Damage Scenario Identification
**Input needed:** Asset list with security properties  
**Output:** Set of damage scenarios describing what could happen if security properties are violated  
**Next step:** Impact Rating

## 4. Impact Rating (Severity Assessment)
**Input needed:** Damage scenarios, system safety requirements  
**Output:** Impact ratings for each damage scenario (SFOP: Safety, Financial, Operational, Privacy)  
**Next step:** Threat Scenario Identification

## 5. Threat Scenario Identification
**Input needed:** Assets, damage scenarios, threat catalogs (1000.csv, 3000.csv, UNECE R155 Annex 5)  
**Output:** Specific threat scenarios describing how attackers could cause identified damage  
**Next step:** Attack Path Analysis

## 6. Attack Path Analysis
**Input needed:** Threat scenarios, system architecture, entry points  
**Output:** Attack paths showing step-by-step exploitation routes through the system  
**Next step:** Attack Feasibility Assessment

## 7. Attack Feasibility (Likelihood) Rating
**Input needed:** Attack paths, vulnerability information, attacker profiles  
**Output:** Feasibility ratings for each attack path based on technical difficulty, knowledge, resources, and time  
**Next step:** Risk Determination

## 8. Risk Determination (Risk Value Calculation)
**Input needed:** Impact ratings, attack feasibility ratings  
**Output:** Risk values for each threat scenario using formula or risk matrix  
**Next step:** Risk Treatment Decision

## 9. Risk Treatment Decision
**Input needed:** Risk values, organizational risk acceptance criteria  
**Output:** Risk treatment decisions for each unacceptable risk (Mitigate, Accept, Avoid, Transfer)  
**Next step:** Cybersecurity Goals Definition

## 10. Cybersecurity Goals (Requirements) Definition
**Input needed:** Risk treatment decisions, damage scenarios  
**Output:** Specific cybersecurity goals mapped to each risk requiring mitigation  
**Next step:** Cybersecurity Claims

## 11. Cybersecurity Claims (Evidence Requirements)
**Input needed:** Cybersecurity goals  
**Output:** Claims and arguments for how each security goal will be verified  
**Next step:** Cybersecurity Concept Development

## 12. Cybersecurity Concept Development
**Input needed:** Cybersecurity goals, claims, system architecture  
**Output:** Security requirements allocated to specific system elements  
**Next step:** Documentation and Residual Risk Acceptance

## 13. Documentation and Residual Risk Acceptance
**Input needed:** All TARA outputs, remaining risk information  
**Output:** Comprehensive TARA report with formal acceptance of residual risks  
**Next step:** Review and Validation

## 14. Review and Validation of Results
**Input needed:** Complete TARA documentation  
**Output:** Verified and approved TARA with stakeholder sign-off  
**Next step:** Continuous Monitoring

## 15. Continuous Monitoring
**Input needed:** Final TARA, change management process  
**Output:** Triggers for TARA updates and periodic reassessment  
**Next step:** Periodic Re-assessment

Each step builds on the previous, creating a comprehensive chain of evidence from item definition through risk treatment and monitoring. The process precisely follows ISO/SAE 21434 clauses and UNECE R155 requirements while maintaining traceability throughout.
