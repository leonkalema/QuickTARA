# Database Migration Implementation Notes

## Overview of Changes

The following changes have been made to implement database migrations with Alembic:

1. **Alembic Configuration**
   - Created alembic.ini in the project root
   - Set up the migrations directory structure in db/migrations/
   - Created environment configuration in env.py
   - Added script.py.mako template for migration files

2. **Initial Migrations**
   - Created initial migration script to establish the database schema
   - Added migration for the review decisions table

3. **Database Model Enhancements**
   - Added ReviewDecision model to db/base.py
   - Updated env.py to include all models

4. **Review Service Updates**
   - Modified ReviewService to use database instead of files
   - Implemented migration script for existing review data

5. **Database Utility Scripts**
   - Created db_migrate.py for simplified migration management
   - Created db/migrate_review_data.py for data migration

## Changes to Database Initialization

The database initialization process (init_db) in db/session.py has been updated to:
1. Attempt to run Alembic migrations first
2. Fall back to direct table creation if migrations fail

This ensures that the application will continue to work even if Alembic is not set up correctly, providing a seamless transition.

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation has been added or updated:
- Created db/README.md with database usage instructions
- Created db/migrations/README.md with migration commands
- Updated TASKS.md to mark database migrations as complete
- Updated TODO.md to mark Alembic setup as complete

## Migration Management

Migrations are now managed in two ways:

1. **Direct Alembic Commands**
   ```bash
   alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Description"
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Helper Script**
   ```bash
   python db_migrate.py create "Description"
   python db_migrate.py upgrade
   ```

The helper script simplifies the most common operations and provides better error handling.

## Data Migration Strategy

For the review decisions, a migration script has been created to:
1. Read existing review decisions from JSON files
2. Create corresponding entries in the review_decisions table
3. Preserve all metadata including reviewer information, justifications, etc.

This allows for a seamless transition from file-based storage to database storage.

## Testing the Migrations

To test the database migrations:

1. Run the database initialization:
   ```bash
   python quicktara_web.py --initialize-db
   ```

2. Verify the tables were created:
   ```python
   from sqlalchemy import inspect
   from db.session import get_engine
   
   engine = get_engine()
   inspector = inspect(engine)
   print(inspector.get_table_names())
   ```

3. Test a database operation:
   ```python
   from db.session import get_session_factory
   from db.base import Component
   
   Session = get_session_factory()
   session = Session()
   components = session.query(Component).all()
   print(f"Found {len(components)} components")
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Update the API services to use the new database models consistently**
   - The risk review service has been updated, but other services may need updates to use the latest database features

2. **Create database upgrade/migration UI**
   - Add a web interface for database migration management
   - Display current database version and available migrations

3. **Implement backup mechanism before migrations**
   - Create automatic backups before running migrations
   - Provide rollback options in case of migration failures
