# Vulnerability Setup Summary

## What Was Created

I've created or migrated the vulnerability tables and data for QuickTARA. Here's what was set up:

### 1. Database Models (in `db/base.py`)
- `Vulnerability`: Core vulnerability definitions
- `VulnerabilityCWEMapping`: Maps vulnerabilities to CWE entries
- `VulnerabilityCVEMapping`: Maps vulnerabilities to CVE entries
- `VulnerabilityAssessment`: Links vulnerabilities to specific components in analyses
- `VulnerabilityMitigation`: Defines mitigation strategies for vulnerabilities

### 2. Database Migration
- Created Alembic migration file: `db/migrations/versions/003_add_vulnerability_tables.py`
- Updated `db/migrations/env.py` to include vulnerability models

### 3. Setup Scripts
- `db_create_vulnerability_tables.py`: Creates vulnerability tables in the database
- `add_vulnerability_data.py`: Adds initial sample vulnerability data
- `verify_vulnerability_setup.py`: Verifies the setup is correct
- `setup_vulnerability.sh`: Shell script to run all setup steps
- `test_vulnerability_api.sh`: Test script for future API endpoints

### 4. Documentation
- `setup_vulnerability_instructions.md`: Detailed setup instructions
- This summary file

## How to Use

1. **Run the setup**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_vulnerability.sh
   ./setup_vulnerability.sh
   ```

2. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   python verify_vulnerability_setup.py
   ```

3. **Check data**:
   The setup includes 3 sample vulnerabilities with CWE mappings and mitigations:
   - VULN-001: CAN Message Injection
   - VULN-002: Firmware Update Manipulation
   - VULN-003: Diagnostic Interface Abuse

## Next Steps

According to TASKS.md, the next steps for vulnerability assessment are:

1. Create vulnerability scanning algorithm
2. Create API endpoints for vulnerability assessment
3. Map vulnerabilities to additional CWE/CVE references
4. Create vulnerability UI components
5. Implement severity visualization

The database foundation is now ready for these features to be built on top of it.
