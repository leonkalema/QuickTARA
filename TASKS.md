## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

1. **File Length**: Keep all files under 350 lines of code
2. **Modular Design**: Single responsibility principle for all modules
3. **Documentation**: All functions, classes, and modules must have docstrings
4. **Type Annotations**: Use Python type hints consistently
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with descriptive messages

### Python/Backend Standards

1. **Code Formatting**
   - Follow PEP 8 style guide
   - Use 4 spaces for indentation
   - Maximum line length of 100 characters
   - Use consistent naming conventions:
     - `snake_case` for variables and functions
     - `PascalCase` for classes
     - `UPPER_CASE` for constants

2. **Imports**
   - Group imports in the following order:
     1. Standard library imports
     2. Third-party imports
     3. Local application imports
   - Use absolute imports for application modules

3. **FastAPI Practices**
   - Use dependency injection for database and services
   - Define request/response models with Pydantic
   - Use appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Use path parameters for resource identifiers
   - Use query parameters for filtering/pagination

4. **Database Operations**
   - Use SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
   - Keep database logic in service layer
   - Use transactions appropriately
   - Handle database errors gracefully

5. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for all API endpoints
   - Write integration tests for services
   - Mock external dependencies in tests

### Frontend Standards

1. **Code Formatting**
   - Use 2 spaces for indentation in frontend files
   - Follow Svelte style guide
   - Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

2. **Component Design**
   - Keep components small and focused
   - Use props for component configuration
   - Use Svelte stores for state management
   - Separate UI components from logic

3. **CSS/Tailwind**
   - Use utility-first approach with Tailwind
   - Create custom components for repeated patterns
   - Use consistent spacing and sizing
   - Follow responsive design principles

4. **API Integration**
   - Centralize API calls in dedicated modules
   - Handle loading states and errors consistently
   - Use proper error handling and user feedback

5. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for complex components
   - Test critical user flows

## Git Workflow

1. **Branches**
   - `main`: Production-ready code
   - `develop`: Integration branch for features
   - Feature branches: `feature/feature-name`
   - Bug fixes: `fix/bug-description`

2. **Commits**
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Include ticket/issue reference if applicable
   - Keep commits focused on single changes

3. **Pull Requests**
   - Create PRs for feature branches to merge into develop
   - Include description of changes
   - Ensure tests pass before merging

## Definition of Done

A task is considered done when:

1. Code is written according to the standards
2. All tests pass
3. Documentation is updated
4. Code has been reviewed (if applicable)
5. Feature is working as expected in the application
